This project use centroidal voronoi tessellation(CVT) algorithm to compute location of robots in 3D space, mainly contain a function called CVT.
To call this function just include the CVT.hpp is enough, the usage of this function is in CVT.hpp.
To build this project just input make in the terminal and it will output a file named libCVT.a, link it to your project.
To rebuild this project input make clean and input make.
